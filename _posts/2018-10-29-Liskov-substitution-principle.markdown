The third of the **SOLID** principles is the Liskov Substitution Principle and it can be paraphrased as follows:

> Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program
>
> <cite>Barbara Liskov</cite>

Basically this tells us that **every subclass should be interchangeable for their base/parent class**.

To better understand it, let's imagine to have a base class called **Food** with two sub-classes **Vegetable** and **Meat**.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![schema!][schemaOk]

We see that both sub-classes inherit the function **caloriesPer100g()** and also add one specialized function each, depending on their nature.
We can therefore assign an object of type **Vegetable** or that of type **Meat** to a reference of type **Food** and invoke on it all functionalities acquired via inheritance.

**The Liskov substitution principle assures that what will be invoked is in fact the actual objectâ€™s overridden implementation of these methods**.

{% highlight java %}

Food food = new Vegetable();
Float calories = food.caloriesPer100g();
food = new Meat();
calories = food.caloriesPer100g();

{% endhighlight %}

# Violation of the principle

When applying the Liskov principle one could tend to apply a **IS A** relation between the classes, assuming for example that **a Vegetable IS A Food**.
This is not per se a wrong assumption, but we need to be careful because it could lead to misleading scenarios like the following.
Let's imagine to have a base class called **Rectangle** with a sub-class **Square**.

{: style="text-align:center"}
![schema!][schemaWrong]

Inherently a **Rectangle** can have its height and its width different and freely changeable (ok ok they should still remain non null positive numbers), but this doesn't hold up for a **Square** which inherently needs to have equally long sides.

In this case the **setHeight()** and **setWidth()** of the **Square** behave differently and need to set both parameters, creating a violation of the Liskov substitution principle.

In the following posts I will discuss the next principle highlighted by the SOLID acronym, the **Interface segregation principle**
