## Short summary
Iâ€™m an Italian guy born and raised in Venice.

After 20-something years I decided to challenge life going to live abroad in Finland for a while where I got used to snow, -30 Â°C and bathing in frozen lakes (you should try that... itâ€™s fun!)

Afterwards I answer Amsterdamâ€™s call and I moved there (where I currently reside) in the end of 2011.

## Professional side
I'm an Android developer in the field since 2011.

I'm currently working for <a href="https://usabilla.com/" target="_blank">Usabilla</a>, and previously I worked on many important projects in different sized companies from small family-like groups to big enterprises, both as an employee and a consultant.

Here is [my CV](https://kioli.github.io/assets/cv.pdf) for you to have a better idea ðŸ™‚

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, ideas or even if you just want to say hi.

## Personal side
I speak 4 languages (5 if you count Venetian as one, which Wikipedia does ðŸ™‚) Italian, English, Spanish and Dutch (not very well but I'm learning).

I've trained for several years in theatre improvisation and acting, following courses on Meisner technique, method acting, Italian 'commedia dell'arte', mime, pantomime and singing.

I do shows regularly a couple of times per month in Amsterdam.

I also love to swim, run and be active in general, to play the ukulele and many other things ðŸ™‚
